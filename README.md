# Matthew55's dmenu

Extra stuff added to vanilla dmenu:

- reads Xresources (ergo pywal compatible)
- alpha patch, which importantly allows this build to be embedded in transparent st
- `-P` for password mode: hide user input
- `-r` to reject non-matching input
- dmenu options are mouse clickable

## Installation

After making any config changes that you want, but `make`, `sudo make install` it.
